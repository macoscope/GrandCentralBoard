Hang a TV in your open space or team room to show everyone what's up and get them up to speed.  

The board is a lightweight piece of code. The TV screen is to be used in landscape orientation and will be split into six rectangular widgets loaded from a remote configuration file. This is just a UIView, so you can use the space in any way you want. Updating the widgets is standardized, though, therefore you should not ignore this convention.

‚úã Don't even ask - it's obviously written entirely in ‚ô•Ô∏è [Swift 2.2](https://swift.org).

## GCBCore

The small set of sources needed to load configuration, initialize and show the Board.

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. 

You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate GCBCore into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'GCBCore', '~> 1.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Usage

This is how you configure Grand Central Board:

```swift
let autoStack = AutoStack()
let scheduler = Scheduler()
let dataDownloader = DataDownloader()

let availableBuilders: [WidgetBuilding] = [
    ImageWidgetBuilder(dataDownloader: dataDownloader),
]

let configFileName = NSBundle.localConfigurationFileName
let configurationFetching = LocalConfigurationLoader(configFileName: configFileName,
                                                     availableBuilders: availableBuilders)

let boardController = GrandCentralBoardController(scheduler: self.scheduler, stack: self.autoStack)

let configurationRefresher = ConfigurationRefresher(interval: configRefreshInterval,
                                                    configuree: boardController,
                                                    fetcher: configurationFetching)

// in ViewController:
                                                    
override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)

    view = autoStack

    configurationRefresher.start()
}
```

# Widgets

## Adding a new Widget

There is a separate article ([TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md)) covering adding new widgets.

## Components

A Widget consists of four main components:

- **View**: a view implementing `ViewModelRendering` protocol that displays the information.
- **Source**: implements one of the updating strategies (further described below).
- **Widget**: a controller class implementing `Widget` protocol that is exposed to the scheduler and connecting previous two components with each other.
- **WidgetBuilder**: implements `WidgetBuilding` protocol, instantiate Widget with settings from configuration file.


## Size

Widget canvas for 1080p:

- 640pt x 540pt

This size is constant and won't change on tvOS.

The GCBCore v2.0 will support iOS target but the canvas sizes are yet to be defined.

## Configuration

There are two ways to configure Grand Central Board: with a remote or bundled configuration file. 
A `JSON` file formatted like this is used to configure the Grand Central Board:

```json
{ "widgets":[ 
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} },
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} },
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} },
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} },
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} },
    {"name":"somewatch", "settings":  {"timeZone":"Europe/Warsaw"} }
]}
```

**NOTE:** Each widget will have its own settings properties.

The way a configuration file is loaded is specified in `Info.plist` file.

### Remote configuration file

To have the configuration file loaded from a remote location, edit `Info.plist` and set `GCBRemoteConfigurationPath` to the desired location. Make sure `GCBAlwaysUseLocalConfigurationFile` is set to `NO`.

### Bundled configuration file

To use a bundled configuration file, set `GCBAlwaysUseLocalConfigurationFile` in `Info.plist` to `YES`. If necessary edit `GCBLocalConfigurationFileName` and check if the file is listed under `Copy Bundle Resources` in `Build Phases`.
For development purposes you can also launch the application via `GrandCentralBoard-LocalConfig` scheme.

## View States

Widget view should show these states:

- **Waiting** - starting state, presenting some activity indicator.
- **Rendering** - presenting information (after render method is called).
- **Failed** - data failed to load, should be avoided if possible.

## Source

The source should implement one of two protocols:

- **Synchronous** - the source will return value synchronously in a non-blocking way.

```swift
protocol Synchronous : Source {
    func read() -> ResultType
}
```

- **Asynchronous** - the source will call the provided block after the value is retrieved (only once). 

```swift
protocol Asynchronous : Source {
    func read(closure: (ResultType) -> Void)
}
```

- **Subscribable** - the source will call the provided block each time a new value arrives (multiple times). Note that `interval` can and often will be ignored.

```swift
public protocol Subscribable : Source {
    var subscriptionBlock: ((ResultType) -> Void)? { get set }
}
```

Fail can be handled silently, but there may be Widgets for which the fail state should be presented, the choice is up to you.

All strategies inherit the **Source** protocol:

```swift
public enum SourceType {
    case Cumulative
    case Momentary
}

public protocol UpdatingSource : class {
    var interval: NSTimeInterval { get }
}

public protocol Source : UpdatingSource {

    associatedtype ResultType

    var sourceType: SourceType { get }
}
```
