/**
Abstract base Operation class which subclasses `NSOperation`.

Operation builds on `NSOperation` in a few simple ways.

1. For an instance to become `.Ready`, all of its attached
`OperationCondition`s must be satisfied.

2. It is possible to attach `OperationObserver`s to an instance,
to be notified of lifecycle events in the operation.

     The `log` property can be used as the interface to access the logger.

     the `Operation`, do this:

    ```swift
    log.info("This is my message")

     `Operation`, access it via this property too:

     The logger is a very simple type, and all it does beyond
     manage the enabled status and severity is send the String to
     a block on a dedicated serial queue. Therefore to provide custom
     logging, set the `logger` property:

     ```swift
     log.logger = { message in sendMessageToAnalytics(message) }
     ```

     By default, the Logger's logger block is the same as the global
     LogManager. Therefore to use a custom logger for all Operations:
